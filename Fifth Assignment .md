# Abstract
------
*In this Report, I will show some codes which are used to slove some realistic projection motions. Along with the book, I will show you: Two-dimensional projectile motion with air resistance---Problem 2.9.

# Background
------
Calculate the trajectory of our cannon shell including both air drag and the reduced air density at high altitudes so that you can reproduce the results in Figure 2.5. Perform your calculation for different firing angles and determine the value of the angle that gives the maximum range.

and the initial speed was 700m/s. The lower two curves were for a firing angle 35°, while for the top curves it was 45°. Note that the x and y scales are different.
