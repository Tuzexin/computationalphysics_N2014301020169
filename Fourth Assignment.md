# Abstract
------
By the drawing function of Matplotlib insde the Python and the numerical approach, we can learn the decay process of radioactive particles.
# Background
------
Consider again a decay problem with two types of nuclei A and B, but now suppose that nuclei of type A decay into ones of type B, while nuclei of type B decay into ones of type A. Solve this system of equations for the numbers of nuclei. Strictly speaking, this is not a "decay" process, since it is possible for the type B nuclei to turn back into type A nuclei. A better ananlogy would be a resonance in which a system can tunnel or move back and forth between two states A and B which have equal enerdies. The corresponding rate equations are
